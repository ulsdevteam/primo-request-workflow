# primo-request-workflow
Takes a link from an 'unavailable' Ex Libris Primo VE record and checks to see if it is avaliable for borrowing via EZ Borrow.  If so, the user can submit a form to request the book.  If not, they are directed to a pre-populated ILLIAD form based on their campus affiliation.
